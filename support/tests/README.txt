In these directories are contained our (hopefully) ever-expanding array of CA unit tests. All tests are written for use with the PHPUnit (http://www.phpunit.de/) testing framework and should be run with the phpunit command.

If you receive errors while running any of these tests it may indicate a bug in CA or a problem with your set up. If you think the error indicates the former please contact us at support@collectiveaccess.org. Don't forget to include the full text of any error messages. And please do contact us... the only way bugs get fixed is if we know about them. :-)
