qt-faststart is a utility that rearranges a Quicktime file such that the moov atom
is in front of the data, thus facilitating network streaming. If installed on your system
CollectiveAccess can process incoming Quicktime files with it, allowing video playback of
Quicktime to start before the entire file is downloaded.

By default CollectiveAccess looks for qt-faststart in /usr/local/bin, but you can change the location
by modifying the appropriate setting in app/conf/external_applications.conf

The qt-faststart.c source file in this directory must be compiled with gcc or some other C compiler
before it can be used. If you're on Linux the following should work:

gcc qt-faststart.c -o qt-faststart
