Todo:
-----

1. Complete labeling features - right now they're somewhat buggy and incomplete.

2. Eliminate .fla file containing user interface elements, and migrate to something like SWFMill, or to a completely Actionscript-based interface. Using a .fla file means that if you want to modify certain basic aspects of the user interface (but *not* the core image load and display functionality) you have to have a copy of Adobe Flash 8, which is not free software.

3. Improve tile loading system to better prioritize the loading sequence.

4. Add measurement and scaling features.

5. Ability to zoom into specific labeled regions.
